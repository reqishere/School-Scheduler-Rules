# School Scheduler CRUD Application - Project Plan

## Overview
Building a school scheduling system with teacher assignments and configurable rules (minimum hours per teacher, class assignments, etc.)

## Phase 1: Core Data Models and Basic CRUD ✅
- [x] Create database models for Teachers, Classes, Schedules, and Rules
- [x] Implement Teacher CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- [x] Implement Class CRUD with fields (name, subject, duration)
- [x] Build main layout with sidebar navigation and header
- [x] Add responsive grid layouts for listing teachers and classes

## Phase 2: Schedule Management and Teacher Assignment ✅
- [x] Create Schedule CRUD interface with teacher-class assignment
- [x] Implement time slot selection (day of week, start time, end time)
- [x] Build teacher assignment dropdown with available teachers
- [x] Add validation to prevent scheduling conflicts (same teacher, same time)
- [x] Display weekly schedule view with color-coded classes

## Phase 3: Rule Engine and Validation System ✅
- [x] Implement Rule CRUD for teacher minimum hours configuration
- [x] Create rule validation engine that checks teacher assignments
- [x] Add real-time feedback showing teacher total hours vs minimum required
- [x] Build validation alerts for rule violations (teacher under minimum hours)
- [x] Add dashboard with statistics (total schedules, teachers, rule compliance)
- [x] Implement rule enforcement when creating/updating schedules

## Phase 4: Auto-Assignment and Subject Requirements ✅
- [x] Add subject requirements configuration (which subjects each class must have per week)
- [x] Build auto-assignment algorithm that distributes teachers across classes
- [x] Implement conflict-free scheduling that respects teacher availability
- [x] Add "Generate Schedule" button with progress feedback

## Phase 5: Subject Rules CRUD Interface
- [ ] Create UI for managing subject requirements per class
- [ ] Add validation to ensure required subjects are scheduled
- [ ] Display visual indicators showing which subjects are missing
- [ ] Build compliance report showing subject coverage

## Phase 6: Enhanced Auto-Assignment Features
- [ ] Implement intelligent teacher-subject matching based on expertise
- [ ] Add constraint solver to optimize schedule generation
- [ ] Build preview mode before applying generated schedules
- [ ] Add ability to regenerate or adjust auto-generated schedules
